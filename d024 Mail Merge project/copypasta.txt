    "If, according to Kanye West, one good girl is worth a thousand bitches, and if, according to Lil Wayne, bitches
come a dime a dozen, does that mean one good girl is worth $8.33?"

"Well, $8.35 in Canada."

    "In Thailand, $8.33 is about 275 Baht. 275 Baht will get you a skanky one in a Thai brothel. If you want a really
good hooker, it'll cost you at least 2000 Baht, or about $61.00. So in Thailand a good woman is worth $61.00 or $732 a
dozen."

"Yes."

    "However, to further this, according to 2Pac Mo' Money= Mo' Bitches If you divide out Mo', you will see that
money = bitches Therefore, 1000 of a 'money' = one good girl. To extrapolate further, diving with respect to "money"
yields 1 money = $0.00833. This changes everything, because money isn't worth hardly anything."


    "True. a linear relationship between money and bitches means the equation relating money to them is in the form of
y=ax+b, where x is money and y is bitches. Consulting the Lil Wayne theorem, if 12 bitches are worth $0.10, then one is
$0.0083. Therefore, we know that the equation 1=a(.0083)+b must hold true and so must 12=a(.1)+b. To find the equation
relating money to bitches must have "a" and "b" values which satisfy the two previous equations. Since "Mo'" implies a
positive linear relation, we know "a" must be positive. I have done the math for you and found that a=119.96 and
b=.0043. So, (Bitches)=119.96(Money) + .0043. To find the number of good girls you get from an amount of money, simply
divide the number of bitches by 1000 (because of the Kanye West Theorem)."


    "No, but biggie said mo' money= mo' problems so money=problems and since mo' money mo' bitches, we can see that
bitches=problems."


    "Well one must first consult the "50 Cent Law": "Mo' Money, Mo' Problems". Here we see that the amount of money is
proportionate to the number of problems. Then one must factor one of the basic rules of the "The Carter Theorem" : "I
got 99 problem but a bitch ain't one". Here we see that without a "bitch" the average person will have exactly 99
problems. Therefore, the formula must be applied:

    (current amount of money) (8.33) / ln[(Problems100-1 ) (current amount of money)]bitches = worth of bitch

    Unfortunately this formula only tells us the value "a bitch" which as we know is only worth one money. Therefore
you must apply [(worth of said prostitute) (problems) * (money-8.33)] + 1 / 1000 = The value of a good girl. Hope this
helps."


    "Yeah, no. That's not how math works. 2pac was merely stating that the derivative of Money in terms of Bitches is
strictly positive. More-over, he skipped a lot of steps in his proof and never formally published the full version. I
bet you believed Fermat's margins really were too small as well, right?


    "Imperial bitches is actually a unit of weight. An imperial one is ~111.1111111112 pounds."


    "There's one fundamental law of math that Lil'Wayne forgot to include in his calculations. We have to follow the law
of "bitches ain't shit" theorized by doctor dre himself. With that principal included we can work out that if bitches
aint shit, and a good girl is worth 1,000 bitches, a good girl is still not worth shit."


    "You're forgetting that Jay-Z published his paper on the "Money Ain't A Thang" theory. Therefore if bitches aren't
worth shit then bitches aren't money and so therefore they ARE, in fact, a "Thang"."


    "Is that the transitive property of bitches? Is it possible that for every bitch, there is an equal and opposite good
girl? That doesn't make sense though because kanye said a good girl is worth one thousand bitches. The economics don't
make sense. Newton or kanye is wrong. They cannot both apply their laws to bitches."


    "I think the important part here is, are we assuming that there is 1 good girl for every 1000 bitches. This is a very
scary thought. 1/1000 females is a good girl and the other 999 are bitches. To me this would make my $8.33 a very good
investment. I paid at least $3000 for my wife's wedding ring. Could I have bought 360 good girls instead of 1 good
girl? B/c I can't help but feel like I have overpaid for my good girl according to the genius of Kanye West and Little
Weezy F. Baby. Don't get me wrong, I love my good girl wife, but I feel duped knowing she may have only been worth 8
bucks instead of 3000."


    "It actually depends on they type of women. If it is a bakers daughter it is less since the sample size is actually
larger I.E. a bakers dozen (13) so: (.10/13)x1000=$7.69 ...0r $9.69 Canadian (not counting the maple syrup)."


    "...How much candy you can buy for $8.33?"

    "Not important.

     We can conclude that 1 bitch is worth approximately 0.83c, but since bitches are of negative value it's actually
-0.83c. This means that in order to get the correct positive value of a good girl there needs to be an exponential
factor involved here. In order to evaluate the amount of good girls needed to offset the bitches you use the simple
formula -0.0083B2 = G. This intuitively makes sense when you think about how the more bitches you have around you the
exponentially higher value even a single good girl has. So when B=1000 we get: G = -0.0083(1000)2 = $68.89 Interestingly
enough, if the entire female population of the US, let's say 150 million for simplicity, were bitches, the worth of one
good girl would then be $1,550,025,000,000 which is just over the total USD currently in circulation."

    "...Damn."
